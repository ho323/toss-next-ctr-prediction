<img width="1877" height="382" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/18644147-6326-4a2e-b444-44efe4b270cb" />  

A click-through rate prediction project for the **TOSS NEXT ML Challenge**, using deep learning and tree-based models for tabular recommendation data.

This repository implements and compares multiple CTR prediction models, including **HDCN**, **Hybrid GDCN**, and **XGBoost**, and provides an ensemble-oriented inference workflow for competition submission.

## Overview

Click-through rate prediction is a core problem in recommendation systems and online advertising.
The goal is to estimate the probability that a user will click on a given item or advertisement based on structured user, item, and context features.

This project was developed for the **TOSS NEXT ML Challenge** hosted on Dacon.
